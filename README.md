# 🔍 Code Chat Assistant – AI-Powered GitHub Repository Explorer  

**Code Chat Assistant** is an AI-driven tool that allows users to interactively explore and understand any GitHub repository. By simply providing a GitHub repo link, the system retrieves and analyzes the codebase using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This enables users to ask any question about the repository and receive contextually accurate answers based on the code, documentation, and project structure.
